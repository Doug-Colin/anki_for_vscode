# Foundations: How the Web Works

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## What is the internet?

The internet is a largely decentralized network of computers initially developed in the mid to late 1960's as an experimental network for sharing computer resources across locations.

## What was the ARPANET?

%
The ARPANET (US military Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was the first wide-area packet-switched network with distributed control and TCP/IP adoption; the telecommunicatons methods and protocols that would eventually serve as the foundation of today's internet.

## What is packet switching?

Packet switching is a telecommunications method of transmitting data by breaking it down into small, formatted, independently routed 'packets';

## What is a packet, or network packet?

A packets, or network packet, is a small formatted unit by which data is transferred between clients and servers on the web. Each packet is formatted into a header containing information crucial for transmission and a payload or 'body' containging the actual data being sent.

## What is the format of a network packet?

A network packet is formatted into a header and a payload or 'body'; the header contains metadata including source and destination addresses, content type packet sequence number,  and content type and size.

## What is the difference between a web page, a website, a web app, and a web server?

A web page is a single document that can be displayed in the browser, whereas a website is a collection of pages grouped together; a webb app is a website that provides functionality to users beyond simply displaying information, and a web server is the computer that hosts any of the above on the internet.

## What is a web browser?

A browser is a program that enables users to view, navigate, and interact with web documents; browsers are the most familiar type of user agent.

## What is a client?

A client is any internet-detected devices that request data from somewhere; it can be a laptop, phone, tablet, a smart device, or in certain circumstances, even a server. 

[#]() [#]() [#]()

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## What is a server?

A server is a computer that stores data and responds to client devices requesting such data.

## What are the two types of browser 'engine'?

Browsers have two types of engines: rendering engines and Javascript engines.

[#]() [#]() [#]()

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Which rendering engines are used by the Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Firefox browsers?

Chrome and Edge use the Blink rendering engine, while Safari uses Apple's Webkit and Firefox uses Gecko.

[#]() [#]() [#]()

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## What are the three primary JavaScript engines used by browsers?

Safari uses Apple's JavaScriptCore engine, while Chrome uses v8 and Mozilla (and thus Firefox) uses Spidermonkey as its JavaScript and WebAssembly engine.

## What is a user agent?

A user agent is a computer program representing a person; the most common user agents are browsers operated by people, though user agents can also be bots scraping websites, download managers, or other apps accessing the web.

## What is a user agent header?
%
A user agent header is a client HTTP request header that identifies the client application, OS, vendor, and or version.

Example in a client request:
```
GET /page.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) Chrome/120.0.0.0
```

## What is TCP/IP?

Transission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), referred to as TCP/IP, are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet. 

[#]() [#]() [#]()

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## What is DNS?

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the plain-language address book for websites; when you enter a URL into your browser's address or URL bar, the browser looks at the Domain Name System to find the websites Internet Protocol (IP) addresss.  

[#]() [#]() [#]()

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## What is a website?

A website is is a collection of web pages built from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, which the browser interprets and assembled into a web page to display to a user.

[#]() [#]() [#]()

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Technically, what happens when a user enters a web address?

% ---- INCOMPLETE ----- --> --> --> 

The Browser:
- goes to the Domain Name System (DNS) server and finds the 'real' address, or Internet Protocol (IP) address, of the server with that registered Domain Name.
- The browser sends a HTTP request to that IP address

## What is a URL?

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a text string that specifies where a resource can be found on the internet. 

[#]() [#]() [#]()

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## ## What are the components of a URL?

A Uniform Resource Locator consists of a protocol (http/https), a domain name, and the path to the resource at that domain. 

[#]() [#]() [#]()

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## What is a web address?

A web address is the non-protocol part of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator); it contains the domain name and the path to the resource at that domain.

***: A way to filter out low quality rhetoric and sustain high quality conversation and critical and or substantive dialogue; for example, repeated rhetorical devices and or argument tropes and debate tactic cliches. Could it be an upvote/downvote system? Too easuly gameable for tribes in its simplest form. What about ... a bot or hardcoded dict that assesses language and categorizes part of sentences/,essages/responses, assessing for those lowest quality things, that could actually be encodeable? New words and language would have to be regularly added. THAT'S AN INTERESTING PROJECT. ***
