# Foundations Introduction To Git

## What's the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git is a version control system that runs locally on your machine, whereas GitHub is a Microsoft-owned cloud platform for remotely hosting, sharing, and collaborating on Git repositories.

## What is checksumming?

%
Checksumming is a method for detecting changes in data by running it through one-way deterministic hash-generating algorithms; the hashes (or 'checksums') are compared against each other over time to identify if and when changes were made.

## What is the difference between checksumming and encryption?

%
Checksumming uses one-way hashing to detect changes by comparing hashes, whereas encryption is two-way and reversible.

## What are the three main states, or statuses, of your files in Git?

Modified, staged, and committed.

That you have changed a file but not yet committed it to your database.

## What does it mean if a file's Git status is staged?

That you have marked the current version of a modified file for your next commit snapshot.

## What does it mean if a file's Git status is committed?

That modified file is safely stored in your local database.

## What are the three main sections of a Git project?

The working tree (or working directory), the staging area, and the .git directory.

## What is the working tree or working directory?

The working tree, or working directory, is a single checkout of one version of your Git project.

## What is the staging area?

The staging area is the index file in your Git directory that stores info about what will go into your next commit.

## What is the .git directory?

The .git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project; this is what is copied when you clone a repo from another computer.

## What does the term 'origin' mean in Git?

The Git origin refers to the remote repository from which 'upstream' changes are pulled.

## How can you use the VS Code editor window to write your Git commit messages?

By typing command `git commit` into the terminal and pressing enter; here you can write multi-line commits. Save via Cmd+S and close the editor window/tab.
